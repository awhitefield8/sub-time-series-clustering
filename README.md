# Sub-time-series clustering

Sub-time-series clustering (stsc) attempts to find clusters of time-series at given intervals of time. Unlike time-series clustering, the clustering is allowed to change through time to better fit the data. This repository provides models and functions that approximation optimal stsc.

## How to use 

The file: test_greedy.ipynb contains a notebook that uses greedy3, the main algorithm proposed.
